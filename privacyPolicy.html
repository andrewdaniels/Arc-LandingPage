                <p>Digital Arc is committed to not discriminating against those who exercise their California Consumer
                    Privacy Act (CCPA) rights.&nbsp; Among other commitments to those exercising their CCPA rights,
                    Digital Arc will not deny access to its services and products, charge different rates, or provide a

                <p>Under California Civil Code § 1798.83, California residents may request from companies conducting
                    business in California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed personal
                    information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, this law
                    provides that if the company has a privacy policy that gives either an opt-out or opt-in choice for
                    use of your personal information by third parties for marketing purposes, the company may instead
                    provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options.</p>

                <p>Digital Arc is committed to providing this alternative option.&nbsp; As part of this privacy policy,
                    Digital Arc allows you to either opt-out or opt-in to the use of your personal information by third
                    parties for direct marketing purposes. &nbsp; Currently, Digital Arc does not sell your information
                    to third parties for marketing purposes.&nbsp; Digital Arc may utilize trusted third parties to

                    option not to receive such marketing communications. &nbsp;</p>
